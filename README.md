# CSS Gradients Lesson 55

CSS gradients allow you to create smooth transitions between two or more colors, adding visual appeal to backgrounds and elements.

## Types of Gradients:
- **Linear Gradient (`linear-gradient`)** → Colors transition in a straight line.
- **Radial Gradient (`radial-gradient`)** → Colors radiate outward from a center point.
- **Conic Gradient (`conic-gradient`)** → Colors rotate around a center point.

## Example Usage:
### Linear Gradient:
```css
.background {
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
}
```
This creates a gradient transitioning from red to blue from left to right.

### Radial Gradient:
```css
.background {
    background: radial-gradient(circle, red, blue);
}
```
This creates a circular gradient transitioning from red to blue.

### Conic Gradient:
```css
.background {
    background: conic-gradient(red, blue, green);
}
```
This creates a gradient where colors rotate around a center point.
